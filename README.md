# spring-jokes-app

Created a simple spring-boot app, using gradle and thymeleaf.
The app uses an external lib to display a random Chuck Norris quote as a joke.
It just uses a simple controller and a simple service with its implementation.
It is supposed to be funny... I did not write the jokes, do not blame me...

It is one of the many small excersices of the course
